GEngine
-------
What?
-----
This repo contains GEngine - a C++, SDL2 and OpenGL 2D game engine and demos/experiments/projects I have made using the engine. 

- GEngine is a 2D game engine, based on SDL2 and OpenGL
- SDL2 (Simple DirectMedia Layer) is used for handling input, audio, windowing and text
- OpenGL is used for rendering graphics

Demos:
------
- demo-platformer: Basic 2D platformer demo
- demo-spaceshooter: Basic 2D space shooter (read: Space Invaders) demo
- demo-topdown: Basic 2D top-down shooter demo. NOTE: Under development

TODO:
-----
- Add better descriptions what the demos consist of to readme.md

GEngine uses code from "Bengine". (The game engine created in Ben Arnold's YouTube Tutorial series "Advanced C++/Graphics Tutorials". Big thanks to him!)
